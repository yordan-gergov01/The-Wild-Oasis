## Best practices

**Component-Based Architecture:**
- The project is structured with reusable and modular components, adhering to the principles of component-based design in React. This approach ensures that each UI element is independently manageable, facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Logic, styles, and UI presentation are separated across components. Business logic is encapsulated, reducing the risk of side effects and making the code more maintainable.

**State Management with React Query:**
- Leveraging React Query for efficient server state management enables optimal data-fetching strategies and provides caching, synchronization, and error handling, creating a smoother and more performant user experience.

**Error Handling and Boundary Management:**
- Implemented with React-Error-Boundary, errors in the UI are gracefully caught and displayed, maintaining application stability and providing informative feedback to users when issues arise.

**Form Handling with React-Hook-Form:**
- Forms are managed using React Hook Form, offering an intuitive, performant, and accessible way to handle input validations and submissions. This approach reduces re-renders and keeps the code clean and efficient.

**Consistent Styling with Styled Components:**
- Utilized styled-components for modular and scoped styling, which keeps the CSS closely tied to its respective components, improving code readability and preventing style conflicts.

**Contextual Theming (Dark Mode):**
- Implemented a dark mode feature to enhance usability in different lighting environments, improving user comfort and personalizing the experience.

**Date and Time Management with date-fns:**
- Utilized date-fns for reliable and flexible date management across the application, particularly helpful in managing check-in/check-out dates, booking history, and daily dashboard statistics.

**Secure Backend Integration with Supabase:**
- Used Supabase as the backend, with best practices for secure data handling, ensuring that user information, reservations, and account data are safely stored and accessible only to authorized personnel.
